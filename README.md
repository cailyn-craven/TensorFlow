# TensorFlow

Before you can build advanced models in TensorFlow 2.0, you will first need to understand the basics. In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to define constants and variables, perform tensor addition and multiplication, and compute derivatives. Knowledge of linear algebra will be helpful, but not necessary.
